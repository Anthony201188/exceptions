## Exercise 1
- Write a program that prompts the user for a number. The number should divide the number 1. Handle the ZeroDivisionError exception and print an error message.
- The program will keep prompting the user to enter a number until a non-zero number is entered.
Hint:
- use a while loop
- research on the keyword: *break*


## Exercise 2
- Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and performs division.
- Handle the ValueError exception if the user inputs a non-numeric value.
Note: The program will keep prompting the user to enter two numbers until a non-zero numeric value is entered as the second number.

## Exercise 3:
- Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of integers and computes the average.
- Handle the ValueError exception if the user inputs a non-numeric value.
Note: The program assumes that the user enters a comma-separated list of integers. If the user enters a list with a different separator, the program will not be able to parse the input and may raise other exceptions.

## Exercise 4:
Create a Python function that receives two parameters: a date and a number of days.   Create a Python function that receives three parameters: a date (datetime object), number of days (integers), timezone (string).
The function should add the number of days to the date, considering the timezone passed as an argument. If the timezone is not valid, the function should raise an exception.
